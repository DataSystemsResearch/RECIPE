## P-BwTree: Persistent BwTree

`P-BwTree` is a crash consistent version of [BwTree](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6544834). 
BwTree is a variant of B+tree that provides non-blocking reads and writes for synchronization. 
It increases concurrency by prepending delta records to nodes. It uses a mapping table that enables
atomically installing delta updates using a single Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operation.
BwTree is an ordered index supporting both point and range queries.

**Conversion**. BwTree is converted into `P-BwTree` by adding cache line flushes and memory fences after each critical volatile store. 

**Performance** Compared with [FAST&FAIR](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast18/presentation/hwang) that is a state-of-the-art ordered index, 
`P-BwTree` shows similar performance to `FAST&FAIR` in all YCSB workloads using random integer keys (**1.13x**, **1.04x**, **0.93x**, **0.92x** 
and **0.92x** performance in Load and workload A, B, C, E respectively).
