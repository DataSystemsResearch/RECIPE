## P-ART: Persistent Adaptive Radix Tree

`P-ART` is a crash consistent version of [Adaptive Radix Tree](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2933352) 
(ART). ART is a radix tree variant reducing space consumption by adaptively varying node sizes 
based on varid key entries. `P-ART` (ART) is an ordered index supporting both point and range queries.

*Conversion*. `ART` using `ROWEX` for concurrency is converted into `P-ART` by applying crash detection 
and recovery mechanisms, along with cache line flushes and memory fences.

*Performance*. Compared with [FAST&FAIR](https://www.usenix.org/conference/fast18/presentation/hwang) 
that is a state-of-the-art ordered index, `P-ART` shows *1.8x*, *1.6x*, *1.12x*, and *1.04x* better performance 
in Load and workload A, B, C respectively using random integer keys while *0.54x* worse in workload E.
